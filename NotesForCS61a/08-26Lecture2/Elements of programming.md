Every powerful language has three such mechanisms:

-   **primitive expressions and statements**, which represent the simplest building blocks that the language provides,
-   **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
-   **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.
