[[Logical Expressions]]
 Names are bound to values, which are distributed across many independent local frames, along with a single global frame that contains shared names. A new local frame is introduced every time a function is called, even if the same function is called twice.

- In order to prevent the suite of a while clause from being executed indefinitely, the suite should always change some binding in each pass.
